## __About me__
I started my career as a chemist in analytical laboratory, I I became a professional in my field and earned the respect of my colleagues after 5 years of work, but I wanted to change a career and decided to try my hand in IT.

I completed IT Project management courses in IT Academy. I learned a lot about Agile methodologies, Risk Management, Project Coordination and etc. This allowed me to find a job and get new experience as a scrum master in a law company.
